Engineering Lead with a strong foundation in full stack development and a passion for building high-performance, scalable web applications. I thrive on tackling complex technical challenges and empowering engineering teams to deliver exceptional results.

As an Engineering Lead, I focus on providing technical guidance, mentoring engineers, and ensuring teams operate effectively using Agile and Scrum practices. I've successfully led the delivery of multiple applications into production that are used daily by multiple state governments.

My technical specialty is front end development, where I design and build enterprise micro front end applications using technologies including React and Module Federation. I collaborate with Product Designers and Product Managers to assess the technical feasibility and scalability of the product vision.

My full stack experience also extends to technologies like ASP.NET, Redis, Postgres and Microsoft Orleans for building highly available applications and Kubernetes, Envoy and AWS for deploying and scaling containerised applications.
